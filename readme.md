Analysis Project

A data analysis project focusing on creating an interactive dashboard to analyze and visualize bike sharing data patterns and trends
Overview

This repository contains code for a Streamlit-based dashboard that allows users to explore bike sharing data patterns. The live version of the dashboard can be accessed at [Streamlit.app](https://vigia2906.streamlit.app/).

> **Note**: The repository is primarily used for deploying the Streamlit app. If running locally, you'll need to modify the data directory paths in the code. The complete runnable code for local execution is included in the Dicoding project submission zip file.

## Dataset

# Dicoding Collection Dashboard 
The analysis uses the Bike Sharing Dataset, which can be found on Kaggle:
